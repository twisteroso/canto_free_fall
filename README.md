# Canto — Free-Fall Detector

Tracks when someone burns **$3M+** of Note (Canto-native USDT/USDC) in a single transaction.

This is not a swap.  
This is **rejection of the entire Canto thesis**.

Canto promised "free banking" — no rents, no middlemen.  
Withdrawing from Note means:
- You're taking your real stables back
- You're leaving the experiment
- You're admitting the dream didn't work (for you)

## Run

```bash
python canto_free_fall.py
